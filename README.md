# Friend Finder

Friend Finder is a full-stack application that allows users to answer questions about themselves and then find their most compatible match to ensure amazing friendship for years to come. The app can be accessed [here](https://mysterious-anchorage-25274.herokuapp.com/).

## Algorithm

This app finds the smallest absolute difference between each person's answers for each question, which are given on a 5-point scale, and returns to the user the other user that was found using this technique. 

## User Flow

The user will first be presented by a welcome page. Once they click the enter button, they will be able to fill out the survey. The survey requires all questions to be answered for it to be submitted. After submission, a modal appears with the user's closest match and their picture. There are also links to the Github repo and the API which is pure JSON.
